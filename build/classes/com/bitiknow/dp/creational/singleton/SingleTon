The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance,  and provides a global point of access to it.
	
Type of Single Ton Pattern
	Eager initialization
	In eager initialization, the instance of Singleton Class is created at the time of class loading, 
	This is the easiest method to create a singleton class but it has a drawback.
	The one problem with this approach is that, the object would get created as soon as the class gets loaded into the JVM.
	
	Lazy initialization
	Lazy initialization method to implement Singleton pattern creates the instance in the global access method. 
	Works fine, in case of single threaded environment.cause issues if multiple threads are inside the if loop at the same time. 
	It will destroy the singleton pattern and both threads will get the different instances of singleton class
		
	Thread Safe Singleton
		The easier way to create a thread-safe singleton class is to make the global access method synchronized,
		so that only one thread can execute this method at a time.
		It reduces the performance because of cost associated with the synchronized method,
		although we need it only for the first few threads who might create the separate instances.
		You need to bear cost of synchronization all the time you call this method,
		while synchronization is only needed on first class, when Singleton instance is created. 	
		
	NOTE : 	
		When a method is synchronized, it locks the Object, if method is static it locks the Class, so it’s always best practice to use
		synchronized block to lock the only sections of method that needs synchronization.
		While creating synchronized block, we need to provide the resource on which lock will be acquired,
		it can be XYZ.class or any Object field of the class.
		synchronized(this) will lock the Object before entering into the synchronized block.
		
	Double checked locking 
		The synchronized block is used inside the if condition, with an additional check to ensure that only one instance of singleton class is created.
		On surface this method looks perfect, as you only need to pay price for synchronized block one time, 
		but it still broken, until you make instance variable volatile.
		
		The issue of the failure of double-checked locking is not due to implementation bugs in JVMs but to the current Java platform memory model. 
		The memory model allows what is known as "out-of-order writes" and is a prime reason why this idiom fails.
		
		The volatile keyword now ensures that multiple threads handle the singleton instance correctly. 
		The volatile prevents memory writes from being re-ordered, making it impossible for other threads to read uninitialized fields of your singleton through 
		the singleton's pointer.

		Consider this situation: 
		Thread A discovers that uniqueInstance == null, locks, confirms that it's still null, and calls singleton's constructor. 
		The constructor makes a write into member XYZ inside Singleton, and returns. 
		Thread A now writes the reference to the newly created singleton into uniqueInstance, and gets ready to release its lock.
		Just as thread A gets ready to release its lock, thread B comes along, and discovers that uniqueInstance is not null. 
		Thread B accesses uniqueInstance.XYZ thinking that it has been initialized, but because the CPU has reordered writes, 
		the data that thread A has written into XYZ has not been made visible to thread B. Therefore, thread B sees an incorrect value inside XYZ, which is wrong.
		When you mark uniqueInstance volatile, a memory barrier is inserted. 
		All writes initiated prior to that of uniqueInstance will be completed before the uniqueInstance is modified, preventing the reordering situation described above.
		
		
		If we do not make the _instance variable volatile than the Thread which is creating instance of Singleton is not able to communicate other thread,
		 that instance has been created until it comes out of the Singleton block, so if Thread A is creating Singleton instance and just after creation lost the CPU, 
		 all other thread will not be able to see value of _instance as not null and they will believe its still null.
		 Why? because reader threads are not doing any locking and until writer thread comes out of synchronized block, memory will not be synchronized 
		 and value of _instance will not be updated in main memory.
		 With Volatile keyword in Java this is handled by Java himself and such updates will be visible by all reader threads.




		
	Bill Pugh solution (Initialization on Demand Holder)
		The implementation of the idiom relies on the initialization phase of execution within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS).[2] 
		When the class BillPughSingleTon is loaded by the JVM, the class goes through initialization. Since the class does not have any static variables to initialize,
		the initialization completes trivially. The static class definition BillPughSingleTonHolder within it is not initialized until the JVM determines that LazyHolder must be executed. 
		The static class BillPughSingleTonholder is only executed when the static method getInstance is invoked on the class BillPughSingleTon,
		and the first time this happens the JVM will load and initialize the BillPughSingleTonHolder class. The initialization of the BillPughSingleTonHolder class results in static
		 variable INSTANCE being initialized by executing the (private) constructor for the outer class BillPughSingleTon.
		 Since the class initialization phase is guaranteed by the JLS to be serial, i.e., non-concurrent, no further synchronization is required in the static getInstance method
		  during loading and initialization. And since the initialization phase writes the static variable INSTANCE in a serial operation,
		all subsequent concurrent invocations of the getInstance will return the same correctly initialized INSTANCE without incurring any additional synchronization overhead.
		
		Using Reflection to destroy Singleton Pattern : Reflection can be used to destroy all the above singleton implementation approaches.
		When you run the above test class, you will notice that hashCode of both the instances are not same that destroys the singleton pattern. 
		Reflection is very powerful and used in a lot of frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
		
		
		
	
	Enum Singleton
	To overcome this situation with Reflection, Joshua Bloch suggests the use of Enum to implement Singleton design pattern as Java ensures that any enum value is instantiated only once in a Java program.
	Since Java Enum values are globally accessible, so is the singleton. 
	Serialization for free.
    Guaranteed one instance (Cannot instantiate more then one enum even through reflection.)
    Thread safe
	The drawback is that the enum type is somewhat inflexible; for example, it does not allow lazy initialization.
	
	
	
	Adding readResolve() To Single Ton :
	So, till now you must have taken your decision that how you would like to implement your singleton. Now lets see other problems that may arise even in interviews also.
	Lets say your application is distributed and it frequently serialize the objects in file system, only to read them later when required. 
	Please note that, de-serialization always creates a new instance.
	Lets understand using an example:
	Lets serialize this class and de-serialize it after making some changes.
	Unfortunately, both variables have different value of variable “i”. Clearly, there are two instances of our class. So, again we are in same problem of multiple instances in application.
	
	To solve this issue, we need to include readResolve() method in our DemoSingleton class. This method will be invoked when you will de-serialize the object. 
	Inside this method, you must return the existing instance to ensure single instance application wide.
	
	Adding serial version id : 
	So far so good. Till now, we have solved the problem of synchronization and serialization both. 
	Now, we are just one step behind our correct and complete implementation. And missing part is serial version id.

	This is required in condition when your class structure can change in between you serialize the instance and go again to de-serialize it. 
	Changed structure of class will cause JVM to give exception while de-serializing process.

	
		

	
How to create a class using the Singleton Pattern
	Step 1: Provide a default Private constructor
	Step 2: Create a Method for getting the reference to the Singleton Object
	Step 3: Make the Access method Synchronized to prevent Thread Problems : It could happen that the access method may be called twice from 2 different classes at the same time and hence more than one object being created.

		Java.lang.Runtime with getRuntime() method 
		Java.awt.Toolkit with getDefaultToolkit() 
		Java.awt.Desktop with getDesktop()
